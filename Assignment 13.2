### First foray into JSON!  This assignment reads info from a website, find the specific dictionary/list and adds the number of and numbers
#### Had to find out about .decode utf8, was not in python2 assignment.
### more struggles converting python 2 to 3!
### Getting better!

from urllib.request import urlopen
import json

url = "http://python-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_194023.json"
data = urlopen(url).read().decode('utf8')

js = json.loads(str(data))

count = 0
sum = 0
for i in js['comments']:
    counts = js['comments'][count]['count']
    sum += int(counts)
    count += 1

print ("Counts!:", count)
print ("Sum!:", sum)
