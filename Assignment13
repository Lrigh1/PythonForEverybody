### opens an xml document and gets a specific section out!  Did this much faster than the last, albeit with help.

from urllib.request import urlopen
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

url = 'http://python-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_194019.xml'

print ('Retrieving', url)
data = urlopen(url).read()

tree = ET.fromstring(data)
results = tree.findall('comments/comment')

sum = 0
for item in results:
     sum += int(item.find('count').text)

print(sum)
